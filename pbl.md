# INTRODUCTION

## What is Project-Based Learning?

*"Project learning, also known as project-based learning, is a dynamic approach to teaching in which students explore real-world problems and challenges, simultaneously developing cross-curriculum skills while working in small collaborative groups." (From [Why Teach with Project-Based Learning?](http://www.edutopia.org/project-learning-introduction))* http://youtu.be/LMCZvGesRz8 **Project-Based Learning:**
- **Is authentic:** Project-Based Learning is an instructional approach built upon authentic learning activities that engage student interest and motivation. These activities are designed to answer a question or solve a problem and generally reflect the types of learning and work people do in the everyday world outside the classroom.
- **Is in depth:** A well-designed project provokes students to encounter (and struggle with) the central concepts and principles of a discipline.
- **Teaches 21st-century skills as well as content:** These skills include communication and presentation skills, organization and time management skills, research and inquiry skills, self-assessment and reflection skills, and group participation and leadership skills.
- **Is (generally) done by groups:** Performance is assessed on an individual basis, and takes into account the quality of the product produced, the depth of content understanding demonstrated, and the contributions made to the ongoing process of project realization.
- **Respects student input:** Project-Based Learning allows students to reflect upon their own ideas and opinions, exercise voice and choice, and make decisions that affect project outcomes and the learning process in general. (All expanded definitions listed above are from [Project Based Learning: The Online Resource for PBL](http://www.pbl-online.org/)):
- **Is curriculum fueled and standards based** Project-based learning addresses the required content standards. The inquiry process starts with a guiding question and lends itself to collaborative projects that integrate various subjects within the curriculum. Questions are asked that direct students to encounter the major elements and principles of a discipline. (All expanded definitions from this item on are from [Edutopia](http://www.edutopia.org/teaching-module-pbl-what))
- **Asks a question or poses a problem that each student can answer** In PBL, the teacher or the students pose a guiding question: "What happens at night?", "What do nocturnal animals do while we're sleeping?", "What is cystic fibrosis, and how is it caused?", "What would happen if our class formed a business with a real product and started selling stock?", "What will a high school look like in 2050?"
- **Allows students to delve into content in a more direct and meaningful way** Recognizing that children have different learning styles, concrete, hands-on experiences come together during PBL. Field trips, experiments, model building, posters, and creation of multimedia presentations are all viable activities within PBL, and present multiple ways for students to demonstrate their knowledge - there is no one right answer.
- **Asks students to investigate issues and topics addressing real-world problems while integrating subjects across the curriculum** By creating bridges between subjects, students view knowledge holistically, rather than looking at isolated facts. Education scholar [Sylvia Chard](http://www.ualberta.ca/~schard/) says the project approach is an "in-depth investigation of a real-world topic worthy of children's attention and effort."
- **Fosters abstract, intellectual tasks to explore complex issues** PBL promotes understanding, which is true knowledge. Students explore, make judgments, interpret, and synthesize information in meaningful ways. This approach is more representative of how adults are asked to learn and demonstrate knowledge.

## PBL: What It Is (And Isn't)
The Introduction section does a good job at describing what Project-Based Learning (PBL) is, but sometimes it's helpful to understand what something ISN'T. For PBL this is especially useful, because there is often confusion between true PBL and simply having students complete a project.

## PBL: Resources
The educational foundation, [Edutopia](http://www.edutopia.org), is a major proponent of project-based learning, and there are several great resources you should review from their web site:
- [Project-Based Learning: Success Start to Finish](http://www.edutopia.org/stw-project-based-learning-best-practices): This series of articles on PBL in Manor, Texas be the single best resource you can review. It is both a great example as well as a guide to planning your own PBL, and it is broken into several parts:

## Project
Now that you have watched videos and read about Project-Based Learning, we are going to ask you to plan your projects this semester with the goal of using them for Project-Based Learning activities in your current of future classroom. You will be working on many different projects this semester, and your work on these projects will go more smoothly if you have a concrete idea of a topic you wish to teach to with technology. Since there isn't time to think up a new topic every week, I want you come up with one great topic or theme that you can rework week-by-week using different types of educational technology. For example, say you're a history teacher and your topic is the Civil War (Essential question being something like: What was life like for the average soldier during the Civil War?). Given this topic, for the blog assignment, you could have your students blog as if they were soldiers in the Battle of Gettysburg; for the digital story, you could do a virtual tour of the Shenandoah Valley from the perspective of a common soldier or a short biography of a soldier in the siege at Vicksburg. Your assignments can even tie together closer than that. For example, you could do a soldier's story for your podcast and then do the same story for the digital story, but this time using video. That same soldier's story could be the basis of your blog. The course is designed, not to get you to delve deeper into your content area, but rather to make you understand how technology can be used to enhance your teaching in your given content area. By the end, you'll have a better idea of what technology you would want to use in your teaching (and what technology you would not want to use).
### Requirements
1. Determine your grade level
2. Determine your general topic
3. Create two (2) separate PBL ideas for your topic. Each idea should include:
	- A guiding question
	- A 100-150 word description of the tasks and technologies you see your students completing to answer this guiding question and complete this PBL unit.
	- A description of the final project or deliverable (i.e., assessment) students will be completing at the end of the PBL unit.
7. Briefly explain what Texas K-12 teaching standards (TEKS), your PBL units would be covering.
8. *Note that you do not need to plan all the lessons or create resources. This is more of brainstorming exercise, but you should create a good and well-explained (if briefly explained) PBL idea.*
### Steps to Complete This Project
1. Determine your grade-level and the topic of your unit and insert it into the **Unit Overview** section of your student page (on the class web site).
	- Because you will be using a single topic for all the modules on this web site, you should Look over the projects and technologies you'll be working with, so you pick a topic that will fit with the class projects.
	- To help you narrow down your topic, you should **consult the Texas K-12 teaching standards (the [TEKS](http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index2.aspx?id=6148)).** If you are currently teaching, picking your topic/theme will be relatively be easy. If you're not currently teaching, consulting these standards for your given content area will be helpful. **If you are going into an area of education that is not K-12,** you should use any standards relevant to your chosen teaching area or give a rationale for why you chose the topic you did (see below). Consult with your professor if this is the case.
	- [How to Get Projects Off to a Good Start](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/summer-pd-starting-projects-suzie-boss)
5. Provide an abbreviated list of the standards you are meeting in the **TEKS Addressed** section of your student page (See the [TEKS web site](http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index2.aspx?id=6148)). If you are not going to be a K-12 teacher, you can rename this section to reflect the standards of your discipline or you can call it "Rationale for Unit Selection" and explain how and why your topic and theme ties into your field.
6. Create your first PBL idea and guiding question. Write your guiding question in the **Unit Overview** section of your student page. Use the following resources to help you create a guiding question.
	- [How to Write Effective Driving Questions for Project-Based Learning](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/pbl-how-to-write-driving-questions-andrew-miller)
	- [How to Refine Driving Questions for Effective Project-Based Learning](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/pbl-how-to-refine-driving-questions-andrew-miller)
9. Write a 100-150 word description of the tasks and technologies you see your students completing to answer this guiding question and complete this PBL unit.
	- This description should include technologies that will be covered in upcoming modules.
11. A description of the final project or deliverable (i.e., assessment) students will be completing at the end of the PBL unit. **Use the following resources to help with this step.**
	- "Deliverable" is a term that comes out of business and industry, but I like it's use here, because it denotes an assessment that students complete and deliver to a teacher (and it clearly indicates that a traditional testing, which is "taken," is not really an option).
	- [How to End Projects on a High Note](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/summer-pd-ending-projects-high-note-suzie-boss)
	- [Overview of Alternative Assessment Approaches](http://www.essentialschools.org/resources/115): Most (if not all) PBL units ends with some sort of alternative assessment (i.e., not a test). This web site provides a comprehensive list of possibilities for alternative assessment.
	- [Traditional vs. Authentic Assessment](http://www.slideshare.net/freshious/authentic-vs-traditional-assessment) (From [Sildeshare](http://www.slideshare.net))
	- For more information on Authentic Assessment, see the [Authentic Assessment Toolbox](http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/index.htm).
17. Repeat Steps #3-#5 for your second PBL idea.
## Final Check
- Grade level is inserted into the **Unit Overview** section of your student page.
- General topic is inserted into the **Unit Overview** section.
- An abbreviated list of TEKS (or other standards or a rationale, if not K-12) is inserted into the **TEKS Addressed** section of your student page. TEKS are presented in summary form, with the section/sub-section number and a short description of the standard. Section/sub-section numbers alone are not sufficient, but the full text of the standards copied and pasted from the TEKS site is too much.
- Two (2) separate PBL ideas for your topic. Each idea includes:
	- A guiding question
	- A 100-150 word description of the tasks and technologies you see your students completing to answer this guiding question and complete this PBL unit.
	- A description of the final project or deliverable (i.e., assessment) students will be completing at the end of the PBL unit.
- Any discussion requirements for your course has been completed (see the Reflect section of this module as well your class web site for details).
# REFLECT
Here are some questions to get the discussion started in the class forums. Check with your course instructor for specific details on class discussion.
- How will you integrate project-based learning into your classroom, and what is the feasibility of incorporating this method into all content areas?
- What are the challenges in implementing project-based learning in today's classroom?
# EXTEND
This module only looks at the idea stage of project-based learning, but there are many other steps for creating successful PBL. To fully implement Project-Based Learning, you can use the following six steps:
- Start with the Essential Question
- Design a Plan for the Project
- Create a Schedule
- Monitor the Students and the Progress of the Project
- Assess the Outcome
- Evaluate the Experience
To find out more about these six steps go to [How Does Project-Based Learning Work](http://www.edutopia.org/teaching-module-pbl-how). The [Project-Based Learning Online](http://www.pbl-online.org/pathway2.html) web site has also outlined the basics of creating a project in slightly different way:
- [Begin with the End in Mind](http://www.pbl-online.org/end_in_mind/emoverview/emoverview.html)
- [Craft a Driving Question](http://www.pbl-online.org/driving_question/dqoverview/dqoverview.html)
- [Plan the Assessment](http://www.pbl-online.org/PlanTheAssessment/Overview/overview.html)
- [Map the Project](http://www.pbl-online.org/Map/mapoverview/mapoverview.html)
- [Manage the Process](http://www.pbl-online.org/ManagetheProject/projectoverview/projectoverview.html)
